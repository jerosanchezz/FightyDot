Features:
* Local multiplayer: Play with your friend even if you only have one iPhone!
* Challenging AI: Can you beat it on the hardest difficulty?
* Completely free! No ads or in-app purchases.

How to play:

1. Placing
First, take turns to place your pieces on the the board.

2. Taking pieces
If you form a row of 3 pieces, you can remove one of your opponent’s pieces.
(Pieces in a row of 3 cannot be removed until all other pieces have been removed first.)

3. Moving
After you’ve placed all of your pieces, move your pieces by dragging them to empty spots.

4. Flying
When you only have 3 pieces left, you can move your pieces to anywhere on the board!

The first player to be reduced to 2 pieces loses. Good luck!
